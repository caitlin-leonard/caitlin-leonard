## 👋 Hi, I’m Caitlin

I’m an **Electronics and Communication Engineering undergraduate at IIITDM Kancheepuram**,  
also pursuing a **BS in Data Science and Applications from IIT Madras**.

I work at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence and Healthcare**, with a strong interest in
building **machine learning and computer vision systems** that are interpretable, practical,
and research-driven.

I enjoy hands-on experimentation — implementing models, working with real data,
and translating theory into deployable systems.  
Currently, I am gaining research experience as a **Research Intern at IIT Madras**.
